The CNTO assets repository
==========================

This is a distribution place for designers to release their work, to be
included as a PBO-packed addon and used for missions.

Please try to keep some sane structure (categories / directories).

**REMEMBER: Git always stores all curent and past versions, so if you upload
a 10MB image, it will stay there forever (in history), even if you delete it
later on, increasing repository size.**

Due to the big-sized nature of assets, it's expected that this repository
will have to be re-created some time in the future, removing all the past
history/versions, just to keep its size sane. However by not uploading every
tiny small change (in big images/models), you help to reduce these history
rebuilds to a minimum.
